			        <p><b>Storj</b> (pronounced: storage) aims to become a cloud storage platform that can’t be censored or monitored, or have downtime. Storj is a platform, cryptocurrency, and suite of decentralized applications that allows users to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. It uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions for security. Furthermore, it will be way cheaper (10x-to-100x), faster, and more secure than traditional cloud storage services.</p>

					<p>Storj is working hard to solve data security issues with the help of its own web app, <a href="http://metadisk.org/" class="link">MetaDisk</a>, and client app, <a href="http://driveshare.org/" class="link">DriveShare</a>. It is the first decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that uses blockchain technology and cryptography to secure online files. There is no need to trust a corporation, vulnerable servers, or employees with your files. Storj completely removes trust from the equation.</p>

					<p>To best protect your data, files are encrypted client-side on users’ computers before they are uploaded. Each file is split up into chunks which are first encrypted and then distributed for storage across the Storj network. The network is comprised of DriveShare nodes run by users around the world who rent out their unused hard drive space in return for <b>Storjcoin X (SJCX)</b>.</p>

					<p>The decentralized aspect of Storj means there are no central servers to be compromised, and because of the use of client-side encryption, only the end-users have access to their unencrypted files and encryption keys.</p>

			        <p>Storj is a cloud storage platform. The key word in that sentence is ‘platform’ because without it, Storj would just really be a decentralized cloud storage alternative. While a decentralized cloud storage alternative in itself would still be a great product, what we are creating goes beyond that.</p>

					<p>Storj allows users to create decentralized applications. We have already begun to see basic demos using the MetaDisk API and pulling content from the network, including an image viewer, a .txt and .pdf viewer, a music player, and even a video service. Some of these services have even been thrown into a Storj Media Center of sorts.</p>

					<p>Our corporate entity Storj Labs aims to bring decentralized cloud storage to the average business and consumer. With constant data breaches and high costs, users are becoming more aware that the current model of cloud storage is broken. Storj Labs provides DaaS (Data-as-a-Service), as well as help building tools and APIs for customers to be able to interface with this new cloud storage model.</p>

					</ul>
					<p class="small">*Details are subject to change.</p>
					<p>SJCX can be purchased at any time and be added to your address balance to be able to qualify for Test Group C. Also your original crowdsale address can be topped up to and over 10,000 SJCX to be eligible for Test Group A.</p>
					<p>“Not Rewarded” means Group A will only be helping with testing and will not earn coins for sharing their storage. “Rewarded” means you will earn SJCX to share your unused storage during beta testing (Groups B and C).</p>
					<p>Make sure you use an SJCX or Bitcoin address where you control the private keys, we do not recommend using an address from an exchange. We will need to verify you actually own the address before you are allowed to be a tester.</p>

			        <p>The only way a shard could be associated with its decrypted content is if someone publicly distributed the download information and the decryption keys, thus giving up the privacy of the content to make it publicly accessible. Content that is kept private will always be private. When someone posts the download information and the public keys online for mass distribution, they are voluntarily giving up the privacy of their content by letting the public at large be able to access it and decrypt it. Hashes and keys are completely different things. Deriving the hash of a file or a chunk in no way allows you to determine the contents of the chunk.</p><p>For someone to put something on a graylist, you'd have to know how to download all the chunks, how they were encrypted and have decryption keys to see what content was. If a farmer only has a small chunk of an encrypted file, let's say, then even if you had the keys you would not be able to decrypt unless you had all the chunks and knew how to reassemble them and in what order. So users could share ANYTHING they want because it's private. But if they post it on a message board then it can be greylisted.</p>

			        <p>Some people may be wary of allowing obscene or violent content to be hosted or distributed through their nodes. Some people have to realize that there needs to be a shift in belief on all sides for us to make widespread use of decentralized tools a reality. There are institutions and organizations that have only ever known and felt comfortable with top-down, centralized methods of enforcement or management. What we're offering is a completely decentralized way for folks to be empowered and follow their own ethics and beliefs. If you disempower people entirely, they may become afraid and try to lash out with centralized hammers (e.g. outright bans, etc.). </p>
			        <p>We have to realize that not everyone in the public, etc. share our beliefs and you could imagine that the MSM could easily paint a picture that the network allows terrorist, CP people, etc. to share with impunity and ease. Those kinds of things are like a dare to regulators, and then basically you leave it to them to try and come up with ways to stop what they think is wrong. They usually don't care as much about decentralization, so their "solutions" are usually broad and heavy. It also creates an "us vs. them" mentality. By coming up with a decentralized solution that doesn't violate the values of the project, it helps people with different beliefs feel more comfortable</p>

			        <p>Because graylist subscriptions will be distributed and managed by peers, can change over time, and are only relevant when file shard contracts are declined, it is impossible to verify that a given node subscribes to any graylist. A node could hypothetically broadcast what graylists it subscribes to, but given the decentralized nature of the network, there's no guarantee that that information would be accurate.</p>
					<p>There is no singular greylist. There will be many graylists with different content categories. For example, one might be for snuff while the other might be for beheading videos. For example a user running a MetaDisk gateway node and a farmer doesn't want people watching ISIS beheading videos on its node, totally cool with distributing Snowden leaks. He also may not want to deal with video distribution and DMCA request so he disables that too. For any other traffic happy to route that, and get paid his bandwidth fees.</p> 
					<p>At the end of the day users will be providing a service, and they get to choose what service they provide. They could follow US law and collect their fees. But perhaps someone more legally open in Sweden, will open up their gateway nodes to any content. Users will be able to control their nodes as they feel more comfortable with. If AirBNB for your hard drive is an apt analogy, someone may not want to accept a drunken junkie into their home. But they are more than welcome to. So why force them to do it?</p>

			        <p>Many users coming from the Bitcoin space ask us why we created a new token named Storjcoin or SJCX. There is a mix of technical and economic reason why we felt a new token was needed. SJCX is built with CounterParty which uses the Bitcoin blockchain. We have plans to implement Bitcoin in the future when Storj is more stable.</p>
					<p><b>Economics</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li><p><b>No Mining</b> - Doesn’t make sense to use a mined coin for a network designed for the concept of resource “farming.”</p></li>
						<li><p><b>Economic Isolation</b> - Bitcoin price fluctuates heavily. If the price drops by half in a few weeks it may become unprofitable for users to offer their resources. While demand would remain the same, supply of resources would drop significantly causing problems. By using an another token we isolated ourselves from price fluctuations completely unrelated to the Storj service.</p></li>
						<li><p><b>Balance Supply</b> - As the demand for storage space grows the token price should rise, and vice versa. This will allow us to economically balance capacity in the network.</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>These are just some of the economical reasons. A paper is currently being written to address those and more technical reasons in more detail.

			        <p>Our typical policy is that anyone who wants to freelance, or be part of the Storj dev team must put in useful pull requests on our <a href="https://github.com/Storj">GitHub</a>, before we consider working with them. There are plenty of repos and open issues to look at.</p>
			        <p>This is not a guarantee for employment, but we found that people who were excited about building the open-source tool-set perform exponentially better than the people we hired directly. If you have any questions on our repos or how things are built, we would be happy to invite you to our developer chat so you can ask the team directly.</p>
			        <p>For your code to be merged, you have to agree to our <a href="http://storj.io/cla">CLA</a></p>
